# Paper Sizes

[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size)

## A series

ISO 216 (earlier, DIN 476) specifies an A series of paper sizes, A0–10.
Each size has an aspect ratio of $\sqrt{2}$, i.e.,
its height is $\sqrt2$ times its width.  A0, the baseline, is defined as that
whose area is 1 m².  Each successive paper size is
one-half the area of its preceding paper size.

| Name | Width | Height | Notional Width        | Notional Height       |
|:-----|------:|-------:|:---------------------:|:---------------------:|
| A0   |   841 |   1189 | $1000\over\sqrt[4]2$  | $1000\sqrt[4]2$       |
| A1   |   594 |    841 | $500\sqrt[4]2$        | $1000\over\sqrt[4]2$  |
| A2   |   420 |    594 | $500\over\sqrt[4]2$   | $500\sqrt[4]2$        |
| A3   |   297 |    420 | $250\sqrt[4]2$        | $500\over\sqrt[4]2$   |
| A4   |   210 |    297 | $250\over\sqrt[4]2$   | $250\sqrt[4]2$        |
| A5   |   148 |    210 | $125\sqrt[4]2$        | $250\over\sqrt[4]2$   |
| A6   |   105 |    148 | $125\over\sqrt[4]2$   | $125\sqrt[4]2$        |
| A7   |    74 |    105 | $125\sqrt[4]2\over 2$ | $125\over\sqrt[4]2$   |
| A8   |    52 |     74 | $125\over 2\sqrt[4]2$ | $125\sqrt[4]2\over 2$ |
| A9   |    37 |     52 | $125\sqrt[4]2\over 4$ | $125\over 2\sqrt[4]2$ |
| A10  |    26 |     37 | $125\over 4\sqrt[4]2$ | $125\sqrt[4]2\over 4$ |

## B series

ISO 216 also specifies a B series of paper sizes, B0–B10.  These are “in-between” sizes, i.e.,
their dimensions (and areas) are the geometric means of two successive A sizes.
B1 is the geometric mean of A0 and A1, and so forth.

| Name | Width | Height | Notional Width    | Notional Height   |
|:-----|------:|-------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|
| B0   |  1000 |   1414 | $1000$            | $1000\sqrt2$      |
| B1   |   707 |   1000 | $500\sqrt2$       | $1000$            |
| B2   |   500 |    707 | $500$             | $500\sqrt2$       |
| B3   |   353 |    500 | $250\sqrt2$       | $500$             |
| B4   |   250 |    353 | $250$             | $250\sqrt2$       |
| B5   |   176 |    250 | $125\sqrt2$       | $250$             |
| B6   |   125 |    176 | $125$             | $125\sqrt2$       |
| B7   |    88 |    125 | $125\over\sqrt2$  | $125$             |
| B8   |    62 |     88 | $125\over2$       | $125\over\sqrt2$  |
| B9   |    44 |     62 | $125\over2\sqrt2$ | $125\over2$       |
| B10  |    31 |     44 | $125\over4$       | $125\over2\sqrt2$ |

## North American

Canada, Philippines, and the United States primary use dimensional
units based on inches.

**NOTE**: Most metric dimensions are *exact*, because one inch
is exactly equal to 25.4 millimeters by definition.  Those that aren’t
exact are displayed in italics.
